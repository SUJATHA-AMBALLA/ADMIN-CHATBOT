# ADMIN-CHATBOT

This project is a simple e-commerce platform  integraed with a chatbot, for a stationery shop. It allows users to browse products, view product details, and interact with a chatbot interface. 

Unlike typical chatbots designed for customers, this chatbot is built specifically for the **admin**. Admins can log in via the chatbot to easily **add, update, and delete products** on the website. This approach eliminates the need to modify core code, making website management quick and hassle-free.
